# Monte Carlo Estimation of π

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code that estimates the value of π using the Monte Carlo method. The approach uses random sampling of points inside a unit square to estimate the area of a quarter circle, which is proportional to π. The project includes different implementations using (task-1)for loops, (task-2)while loops, and (task-3)user-defined precision with graphical outputs.

## Contents
1. **Code Files**:
   - `task_1.mlx`: Uses a for loop to estimate π with a fixed number of points.
   - `task_2.mlx`: Uses a while loop to estimate π to a specific precision.
   - `task_3.m`: A function allowing user-defined precision and visualizing the process.

2. **Reports**:
   - `Project_Report.pdf`: Briefly explains the results of each task and analyzes the performance.
   - `All_Code_and_Output.pdf`: A PDF containing the code and corresponding outputs for all three tasks.
